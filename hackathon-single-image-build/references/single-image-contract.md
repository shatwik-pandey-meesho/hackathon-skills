# Single Image Contract

The final image must include everything judges need to start the project.

## Required

- React production build copied into the runtime image.
- Node.js server or Go binary in the runtime image.
- SQLite runtime support installed in the image only if the backend needs the `sqlite3` CLI at runtime.
- Database initialization from `db/init.sql` or equivalent.
- Startup script that creates the SQLite database file before starting the app.
- Frontend listens on port `9080`.
- Backend listens on port `8090`.
- Backend `/health` succeeds after startup.

## Base Image

- All stages must use Debian slim base images. Do not use Alpine.
- Node stages: use `node:20-bookworm-slim` (Debian 12 "bookworm", slim).
- Go build stage: use `golang:1.22-bookworm`; final runtime stage: use `debian:bookworm-slim`.
- Reason: Alpine uses musl libc, which frequently breaks the SQLite native build (`better-sqlite3`) and CGO-based Go SQLite drivers. Debian slim ships glibc and "just works" for beginners while staying small.
- Pin the major version in the tag (for example `node:20-bookworm-slim`, not `node:latest`) so builds are reproducible for judges.

## Recommended Runtime Pattern

- Use a multi-stage Dockerfile.
- Build frontend in a `node:20-bookworm-slim` stage.
- Build backend in a `node:20-bookworm-slim` (Node) or `golang:1.22-bookworm` (Go) stage.
- For Go, copy only the compiled binary into a `debian:bookworm-slim` runtime stage.
- Use a simple entrypoint script when database initialization must happen before the app starts.

## Not Allowed For Final Submission

- Requiring Docker Compose.
- Requiring a separate database container.
- Requiring a managed cloud database.
- Requiring local source files mounted into the container.
