description: "Diagnose and fix common hackathon app failures in React, Node.js or Go, SQLite, Docker, GitHub, and proxy registry setup. Use when a non-technical participant says the page is blank, a button does nothing, data is not saving, Docker will not start, SQLite is broken, the image build fails, the app crashes, or an error message is confusing."

# Hackathon Bugfix

## Overview

Convert vague symptoms into a concrete fix. Start with evidence, change the smallest thing that explains the failure, and confirm the app works again.

## Workflow

1. Ask for a screenshot or exact error only if logs cannot be collected locally.
2. Run `scripts/collect_diagnostics.sh` from the project root.
3. Read `references/common-failures.md` for likely causes.
4. Identify the layer: browser, React build, backend API, SQLite, Docker, Git/GitHub, or proxy push.
5. Patch the smallest relevant set of files.
6. Re-run the failing command.
7. Explain the fix as "what was wrong" and "what works now."

## Safety

- Do not delete participant work to fix build errors.
- Do not reset git history.
- Do not wipe SQLite data unless the participant asks to clear test data.
- Do not add a new technology to bypass the real issue.
- For Docker/SQLite failures, keep Debian slim base images; do not switch to Alpine.
- For Node SQLite native packages such as `better-sqlite3`, ensure the Docker build stage installs `python3`, `make`, and `g++`.
- For "data is not saving" after restart, verify the repo-local `data/` directory is mounted into Docker as `/app/data`.

## Memory

- If `.agent-memory/` exists, read `.agent-memory/state.json`, `.agent-memory/session.md`, and `.agent-memory/handoff.md` before diagnosing the issue.
- After the fix attempt, record the symptom, suspected cause, applied fix, and result in `.agent-memory/activity.md` and refresh the current blocker in `.agent-memory/handoff.md`.

## Resources

- `scripts/collect_diagnostics.sh`: collect project, Docker, port, and log evidence.
- `references/common-failures.md`: fast map from symptoms to likely fixes.
